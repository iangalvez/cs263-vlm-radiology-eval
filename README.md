# cs263-vlm-radiology-eval
CS 263 (Natural Language Processing) Final Project: Evaluating Large VLMs on Radiology Report Generation

### Environment
All the environments can be configured within each individual notebook using the code cells.

### Data
Our datasets can be accessed [here](https://github.com/iangalvez/cs263-vlm-radiology-eval/tree/main/MIMIC-CXR-filtered). Besides, the code for data pre-processing is located in [notebook1](https://github.com/iangalvez/cs263-vlm-radiology-eval/blob/main/scripts/notebook1.ipynb).

### Medical Report Generation
The code for medical report generation is in [notebook2](https://github.com/iangalvez/cs263-vlm-radiology-eval/blob/main/scripts/notebook2.ipynb)

###
The code for automated metric evaluation is in [notebook3](https://github.com/iangalvez/cs263-vlm-radiology-eval/blob/main/scripts/notebook3.ipynb)

### Binary Abnormality Prediction
The code for the binary abnormality prediction is in [notebook4](https://github.com/iangalvez/cs263-vlm-radiology-eval/blob/main/scripts/notebook4.ipynb). You can reproduce our results and save the confusion matrices by running the notebook.
