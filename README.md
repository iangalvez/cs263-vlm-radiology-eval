# cs263-vlm-radiology-eval
CS 263 (Natural Language Processing) Final Project: Evaluating Large VLMs on Radiology Report Generation

### Environment
All the environments can be configured within each individual notebook using the code cells.

### Data
Our datasets can be accessed [here](https://github.com/iangalvez/cs263-vlm-radiology-eval/tree/main/MIMIC-CXR-filtered). Besides, the code for data pre-processing is located in the [Data_Preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/iangalvez/cs263-vlm-radiology-eval/blob/main/scripts/Data_Preprocessing.ipynb).

### Binary Abnormality Prediction
The code for the binary abnormality prediction is in the [Binary_Abnormality_Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/iangalvez/cs263-vlm-radiology-eval/blob/main/scripts/Binary_Abnormality_Prediction.ipynb). You can reproduce our results and save the confusion matrices by running the notebook.
