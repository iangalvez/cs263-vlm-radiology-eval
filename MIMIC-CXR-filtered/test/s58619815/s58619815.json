    "EXAMINATION": "CHEST RADIOGRAPHS",
    "INDICATION": "Palpitations and chest pressure.",
    "TECHNIQUE": "___.",
    "COMPARISON": "Chest, PA and lateral.",
    "FINDINGS": "The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within\n normal limits.  The aortic arch shows patchy calcification.  Mild subpleural\n thickening is unchanged at each lung apex for the most part, but there is an\n apparent increase in density in the left upper lung over about 1 cm region. \n Otherwise, the lung fields appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or\n pneumothorax.",
    "IMPRESSION": "1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.\n \n 2.  Possible new left apical lung nodule.  Follow-up chest CT is recommended\n when clinically appropriate."
