    "EXAMINATION": "CHEST (PORTABLE AP)",
    "INDICATION": "___ year old woman with CNS lymphoma,  // assess for pleural\n effusion prior to giving methotrexate",
    "COMPARISON": "58",
    "FINDINGS": "Again seen is the indwelling right-sided catheter, with tip over distal SVC. \n In addition, there is a new right-sided PICC line, with tip overlying the \n right atrium.  No pneumothorax detected.\n \n Inspiratory volumes are low and the right hemidiaphragm remains elevated, with\n opacity at the right base, similar to prior.  Minimal patchy opacity in the\n retrocardiac region is improved slightly.  No gross effusion is detected on\n this AP view.  No definite change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette.\n \n Focal opacity the left upper zone represent artifact due to overlap of the\n first anterior and fifth posterior left ribs.",
    "IMPRESSION": "No gross effusion detected on either side, but smaller posterior effusions\n would not be apparent on this film.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view\n could help for further assessment of posterior fusions.\n \n Continued opacity at the right lung base, similar prior.  This is new compared\n with ___, but similar the most recent prior study.  This most\n likely represents atelectasis, but amount in appropriate clinical setting, an\n infectious consolidation could have similar appearance.\n \n Mild patchy opacity at the left base is improved compared with ___.\n \n New right PICC line tip overlies the right atrium.  Clinical correlation is\n requested."
